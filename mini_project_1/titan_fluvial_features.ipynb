The product of this length times and the cross-sectional area is the volume of a cuboid, so $Q$ is a volume per unit time, e.g., cubic meters per second, as expected from a flux.\n",

If $h$ is the \"run,\" then the displacement of the cross-section $hS$ is the \"rise.\" It makes sense to assume that the displacement of water is due to gravity, so we can use the following kinematic equation:\n",

        "In science, we develop and use predictive models to capture the relationships between any relevant set of quantities that can be measured.

Here we deal with a simpler but related situation: you have a range of values you would like to test, but you have only one equation.\n"
