Taking the square-root of the latter produces a plain velocity, which is a length per unit time. The product of this length times and the cross-sectional area is the volume of a cuboid, so $Q$ is a volume per unit time, e.g., cubic meters per second, as expected from a flux.\n",

If $h$ is the \"run,\" then the displacement of the cross-section $hS$ is the \"rise.\" It makes sense to assume that the displacement of water is due to gravity, so we can use the following kinematic equation:\n",

        "In science, we develop and use predictive models to capture the relationships between any relevant set of quantities that can be measured. Models typically consist of one or more equations, but not all models use equations. Darwinian evolution, for example, is easier to express as a set of instructions (an algorithm).\n",

Here we deal with a simpler but related situation: you have a range of values you would like to test, but you have only one equation.\n"
